## 🎙️ Jarvis AI Desktop Voice Assistant

## 🧠 A Python-Powered Personal Voice Assistant

The Jarvis AI Desktop Voice Assistant is an intelligent, voice-controlled assistant that understands natural language voice commands and responds with appropriate actions. Inspired by futuristic virtual assistants, it leverages speech recognition, text-to-speech (TTS), logic automation, and Python scripting to perform everyday tasks hands-free.

This project showcases practical applications of speech processing, AI logic integration, and desktop automation using Python.
